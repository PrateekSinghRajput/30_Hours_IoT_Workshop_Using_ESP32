## üß∞ Getting Started

1. **Setup Arduino IDE:**  
   - Install the latest Arduino IDE from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  
   - Add ESP32 board support via the Board Manager ([https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32](https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json))  

2. **Connect your ESP32:**  
   - Use a USB cable to connect your ESP32 board to your computer  

3. **Open Examples:**  
   - Navigate to the desired topic folder and open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE  

4. **Install Required Libraries:**  
   - Install libraries such as `DHT`, `OneWire`, `LiquidCrystal_I2C`, `MFRC522`, `Blynk`, etc., via the Library Manager  

5. **Upload & Test:**  
   - Select the correct ESP32 board (Doit ESP32 Devkit v1) and COM port  
   - Upload the sketch and observe the output on Serial Monitor, LCD, or connected devices
